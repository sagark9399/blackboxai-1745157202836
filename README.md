# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Project Overview

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking a square in a 3x3 grid with either an "X" or an "O". The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. This project provides a simple web-based implementation of the game using HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript.

## Installation

To run the Tic Tac Toe game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd tic-tac-toe
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to start playing.

## Usage

- Click on the boxes to place your mark (either "X" or "O").
- The game alternates between the two players each turn.

- You can reset the game at any time by clicking the "Reset Game" button.

## Features

## Dependencies
